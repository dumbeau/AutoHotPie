Radial menus for Windows, designed for digital artists and macro enthusiasts, sponsored by unemployment :)

# Installation

Go to [releases](https://github.com/dumbeau/AutoHotPie/releases), download the latest version and run the installer and install it. Currently, there will be bugs so use at your own risk.

I hope putting a circle on your screen brings you as much happiness as it brings me... shut up that's not lame.

# General Usage

Add pie menus to any application. Similar to Blender pie menus or Maya marking menus.

## Pen Tablets

In order to activate a pie menu with a pen button, go into your pen software and set a key to send '4th click / Forward' or '5th Click / Back'. You may use any other key, but other keys may not send their 'key-up' signal when the pen button is released. You can then set the Pie menu key to respond to '4th click / Forward' or '5th Click / Back' in the 'Special Keys' menu.

## External controllers or Remotes

Most bluetooth controllers can have their buttons assigned to a keystroke in their software, however most do not send their 'key-up' signal when their button is released. To handle this, use the 'Hover over all selections' launch mode. The pie menu will stay open after the button is pressed, and selections can be hovered over to be selected.

# Development

Download this source code and run:

```
npm install
```

[AutoHotKey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/) needs to be installed to compile AHK code.

The HTML/CSS is supplied by bootstrap studio (I know I'm a piece of garbage)
When you open "AutoHotPie Settings.bsdesign", go the the Settings > Export, and set the export destination to the src directory of this codebase.
