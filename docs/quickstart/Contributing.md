# Contributing to the project
We try to follow GitHub flow for our development process. This means that we use the main branch for development and create feature branches for new features. When a feature is complete, we create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch. The pull request is reviewed by at least one other developer before it is merged into the main branch.

Please look for https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request for more information on how to contribute to a GitHub project.

## Checklist for pull requests
- [ ] Running `npm run electron:build` does not cause any errors.
- [ ] Executable generated by `npm run electron:build` behaves the same to that of `npm run electron:local`.
- [ ] There is no conflicts with the main branch.
